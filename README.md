# NR Status

An app to view data from your New Relic account. 

## Disclaimer

This is current a passion project of mine. I love playing with data and I wanted to learn more about SwiftUI. There are a lot of rough edges in this app but if you find a niche that works for you, it can be a powerful tool to visualize your data.

## Features

### Desktop Widgets!

### Other experiments

There is a window at launch that lists some Entities in your account. This isn't currently useful for much, I got distracted by the Charts and Widgets.
